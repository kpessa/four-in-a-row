## Description

- I went through [Team Treehouse](www.teamtreehouse.com)'s JavaScript OOP challenge and worked through the Four-in-a-row game!  The project emphasized OOP principles and connecting JavaScript objects to HTML DOM elements!  Overall, really enjoyed working through the project!  Above is a demo of the final result!

## Deployment
